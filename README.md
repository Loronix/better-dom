_**NOTE:** documentation is currently updating to reflect changes in version 2. If you need the 1st version please use [v1.7.7 tag](https://github.com/chemerisuk/better-dom/tree/v1.7.7)._

jQuery knows a concept called “**live events**”. Using the idea of event delegation they enabled developers to handle existing and future elements. 
But more flexibility is required in a lot of cases. For example, delegated events fall short when the DOM needs to be mutated in order to initialize a widget. To handle such cases I'd like to introduce **[live extensions](https://github.com/chemerisuk/better-dom/wiki/Live-extensions)** and **better-dom** - a new library for working with the DOM.

[API DOCUMENTATION](http://chemerisuk.github.io/better-dom/)

## Quick start
I'd recommend to read one from the articles below to understand the main ideas of the library:
* [Introduction into the better-dom library in English](http://coding.smashingmagazine.com/2014/01/13/better-javascript-library-for-the-dom/) @smashingmagazine.com
* [Введение в библиотеку better-dom по-русски](http://habrahabr.ru/post/209140/) @habrahabr.ru

## Features
* lightweight: ~22 kB minified and ~5 kB gzipped version
* clear, minimalistic and standards-based (where possible) APIs
* [live extensions](https://github.com/chemerisuk/better-dom/wiki/Live-extensions)
* [animations via CSS3](http://jsfiddle.net/C3WeM/5/)
* [microtemplating using the Emmet syntax](https://github.com/chemerisuk/better-dom/wiki/Microtemplating)
* [improved event handling](https://github.com/chemerisuk/better-dom/wiki/Event-handling)
* [getter and setter](https://github.com/chemerisuk/better-dom/wiki/Getter-and-setter)

## Installation
The simplest way is to use [bower](http://bower.io/):

    bower install better-dom

This will clone the latest version of the __better-dom__ with dependencies into the `bower_components` directory at the root of your project. Then just include the script below on your web page:

```html
<script src="bower_components/better-dom/dist/better-dom.js"></script>
```

## Documentation
* Read the [FAQ](https://github.com/chemerisuk/better-dom/wiki/FAQ)
* Take a look at the [better-dom wiki](https://github.com/chemerisuk/better-dom/wiki)
* Check [releases tab](https://github.com/chemerisuk/better-dom/releases) for getting the changes log
* Walk through the sorce code of existing [projects that use better-dom](http://bower.io/search/?q=better-dom).

## Performance

* [DOM.find[All] vs jQuery.find](http://jsperf.com/dom-find-all-vs-jquery-find/10)
* [DOM getter/setter vs jQuery.attr/prop](http://jsperf.com/dom-getter-setter-vs-jquery-attr-prop/5)
* [better-dom vs jquery: classes manipulation](http://jsperf.com/better-dom-vs-jquery-classes-manipulation/6)

## Notes about old IEs
For IE8-9 support you have to incude extra files via the conditional comment below into `<head>` on your page:

```
<!--[if IE]>
    <link href="bower_components/better-dom/dist/better-dom.htc" rel="htc"/>
    <script src="bower_components/es5-shim/es5-shim.js"></script>
    <script src="bower_components/html5shiv/dist/html5shiv.js"></script>
<![endif]-->
```

[html5shiv](https://github.com/aFarkas/html5shiv) provides a fix for HTML5 tags in IE8.

[es5-shim](https://github.com/kriskowal/es5-shim) is used to polyfill/fix missed standards-based functions for `Array`, `Object`, `Function`, `Date` classes.

The **better-dom.htc** file helps to implement [live extensions](https://github.com/chemerisuk/better-dom/wiki/Live-extensions) support. This fact applies several important limitations that you must know in case when legacy browser support is required.

#### Setup content-type header
HTC behaviors have to serve up with a content-type header of “text/x-component”, otherwise IE will simply ignore the file. Many web servers are preconfigured with the correct content-type, but others are not.

    AddType text/x-component .htc

#### Same domain limitation
IE requires that the HTC file must be in the same domain with as the HTML page which uses it. If you try to load the behavior from a different domain, you will get an “Access Denied” error.

## Browser support
#### Desktop
* Chrome
* Safari 6.0+
* Firefox 16+
* Internet Explorer 8+ (see [notes](#notes-about-old-ies))
* Opera 12.10+

#### Mobile
* iOS Safari 6+
* Android 2.3+
* Chrome for Android

Opera Mini is out of the scope because of lack of support for CSS3 Animations.
